# Longshot

This is a blocky sci-fi roguelike.

This was my first cpp project and is pretty gross in a lot of ways. I haven't done anything meaningful to it in a while and figured it was probably time to unleash it on the world at large in case someone wants to make some progress on it or learn how not to program.

## Running

Last I checked, this works on at least Windows and Mac OSX, which means it probably works on Linux ... someone care to confirm?

It makes use of SDL2 and OpenGL, so there is not reason that it shouldn't run just about anywhere.

### Windows

I developed this primarily in Visual Studio. The last version that I was using was VS 2013, so maybe start there? You'll need to download all the SDL development libs and runtime libs.

### Mac OS

Use Brew to install the dependencies (basically SDL2 and all the helpers that are needed).

Then run ```build.sh``` to produce the executable.

### Assets

You'll probably want the amazing assets for this. Get them here in stick them in the same directory as the executable:

Better yet, make better ones send them my way!
